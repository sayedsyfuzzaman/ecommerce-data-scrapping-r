# E-Commerce Data Scrapping and Analysis

This project was all about scraping a data from an e-commerce site and do a complete analysis with that. The whole analysis has helped us gain knowledge with data and their workings which can use in our further data analysis. As we analyzed the data of e-commerce, we could see they are mostly updated e-commerce site which means they update their inventory regularly and they are well managed. But as of the size of e-commerce they can be considered as small because they have just more than 400 products in their inventory. With all the analysis we can come to a conclusion that if they can increase their business with more product they can be more successful and generate more profit if they can keep their good management and inventory keeping skill.
